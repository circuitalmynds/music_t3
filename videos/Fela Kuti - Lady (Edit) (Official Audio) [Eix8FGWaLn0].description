Like Fela’s other early 70's releases, he used each side of his LPs to create a deep groove that pulls the listener in and follows with metaphoric lyrics that call out and critique the corrupt hangover of colonialism. The album is the sound of Afrobeat’s maturation as a global music. Fela’s Pidgin English lyrics extend his music’s audience beyond Yoruba speakers and make his words understandable across the Anglophone world. In “Lady”, Fela highlights the adoption of European social habits to the detriment of African culture.
